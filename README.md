# About

Keep Safe Go is a simple Restful API aimed at encrypting the text field sent in requests.

Technologies used:

- Go `version 1.22`
- MongoDB


# Instructions

This project uses [Docker and Docker Compose, so it's necessary to install them.](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

After installation, rename the files `.env.example` to `.env`. Both are files containing environment variables with default values.

- `.env`: It's used to set the environment variables used by the application.

Afterwards, you can bring up the containers using the bash script below:

```
$ bash up.dev.v2.sh
```
